TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team ##)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics
-2 stories committed and unit testing was not implemented so 2 stories done?
-The point we committed were 13 but since unit testing was missing and the frontend was a bit too simple maybe we were too optimistic
- We planned 8 hour each for the project so a total of 48h and we committed (8h20m 8h30m 8h45m 8h30m 7h 3h)

- Number of stories committed vs. done 
- Total points committed vs. done 
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team)

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |  TTE Error   | Average task | Std Estimated |  Std Actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| _#1_   |    4    |    5   |   12h30m   |   12h15m     |     0.02     |       3      |      0.89     |     1.6     |
| _#2_   |    5    |    8   |   14h30m   |   19h50m     |    -0.26     |       4      |      2.2      |     2.8     |

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  > Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
